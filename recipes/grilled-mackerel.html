    <p>Baked in the oven, this Grilled Mackerel or Saba Shioyaki is the simplest fish recipe you can make on a busy weeknight. Serve steamed rice, miso soup, and a side salad to accompany this flavorful fish!</p>
    <p>Grilled Mackerel or Saba Shioyaki (鯖の塩焼き) is one of the popular seafood dishes served as an entree or part of a bento combination in Japanese restaurants in the U.S. You may already know this, but what you may not know is how fast and easy it is to make this grilled fish at home. This is the reason I love making this for my family dinner — it feels special, but is so very simple.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
        <li>2 fillets mackerel (saba) (10 oz, 280 g for 2 servings)</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp sake</li>
        <li>½ tsp kosher salt (Diamond Crystal; use half for table salt)</li></ul>
        
        <h3>For Serving</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>1 inch daikon radish (2.6 oz, 75 g for 2 servings; grated)</li>
        <li>1 tsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 wedge lemon (cut in half)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul></p>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Gather all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Coat the fish with the sake.</li>
        <li>Pat dry with paper towels (discard the sake) and transfer the fish to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle both sides of the fish with the salt.</li>
        <li>Let it sit at room temperature for 20 minutes. During this time, preheat the oven to 425ºF (218ºC) with a rack placed in the middle. For a convection oven, reduce the cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC).</li>
        <li>After 20 minutes, pat dry the excess moisture released from the fish.</li>
        <li>Place the fish skin side down on the parchment paper and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the flesh is golden brown.</li></ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>To Serve</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Grate the daikon radish (I love this grater) and squeeze out most of the liquid.</li>
        <li>Serve the grilled mackerel on individual plates with the grated daikon and a lemon wedge on the side. Pour a few drops of soy sauce on the grated daikon and use as a refreshing condiment on the fish. Enjoy!</li></ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>To Store</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You can keep the leftovers in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for 2 days.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
