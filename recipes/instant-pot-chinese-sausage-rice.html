        <p>Chinese sausage rice (腊肠饭) made easy using the Instant Pot! No rice soaking required, minimal active cooking time, and perfect results. The rich and savory sticky rice is seasoned with soy sauce and mixed with sweet Chinese sausage and crunchy water chestnuts. It’s an ideal one-pot weekday dinner! </p>
        <h2>Why this recipe?</h2>
        <p> No rice soaking required. Glutinous rice usually requires overnight soaking to cook it on the stovetop. You can skip that step when using this recipe.
            Minimal active cooking time. All you need to do is to brown the aromatics and the sausage in the Instant Pot. It takes about 10 minutes.
            Shortened cooking time. It takes about 25 minutes to cook this dish on the stovetop. The Instant Pot version only takes 12 minutes.
            Consistent (perfect) result. The rice and sausage will be cooked until soft and buttery and the chestnuts until crunchy.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p><ul>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 large shallots , sliced (or 1 onion)</li>
            <li>8 medium-sized (about 0.5 oz / 15 g) dried shiitake mushrooms</li>
            <li>5 links (7 oz / 200 g) Chinese sausage , sliced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups short grain sticky rice (glutinous rice)</li>
            <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>1/2 cup mushroom soaking liquid</li>
            <li>1 cup whole water chestnuts , sliced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dark soy sauce (or soy sauce)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 green onions , thinly sliced (for garnish)</li>
        </ul></p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p><ol>
            <li>Turn on the “Saute” function on your Instant Pot and wait until it’s warmed up (*Footnote 2). Add the butter and stir a few times until it melts.</li>
            <li>Add the shallot and shiitake mushrooms. Stir a few times to coat well with butter. Then spread the ingredients into a single layer. Let cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 6 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>Add the Chinese sausage. Cook and stir until the edges turn light golden, 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour in the Shaoxing wine. Use your spatula to release any brown bits stuck to the bottom of the pan. This is very important. If you don’t deglaze the pot thoroughly, you might get a “burn food” error later on. Cook until most of the liquid has evaporated.</li>
            <li>Turn off “Saute”. Add the rice. Stir to mix the rice evenly with the other ingredients. Add the chicken stock, 1/2 cup mushroom soaking liquid, water chestnuts, soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and salt. Stir to mix well.</li>
            <li>Cover the Instant Pot and seal the valve. Set on “Manual” at high pressure for 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the Instant Pot is done cooking, wait for at least 5 minutes, then switch to fast release by using the release button on your Instant Pot lid. Stay away from the Instant Pot to avoid being burned by the hot steam coming out of the pot when using fast release.</li>
            <li>Fluff the rice and garnish with sliced green onions. Serve hot as a main or side dish.</li>
            <li>Store the leftovers in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 3 days or in the freezer for 3 months. Reheat in the microwave before serving.</li>
